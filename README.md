This is the repo for my portfolio website, [megalon.dev](https://megalon.dev)

I did not use a site generator or any front-end libraries like React of Vue. I decided to write my own page loader to learn how they work. 

The site is made with Typescript, SCSS, and HTML, and I run it on my own Linux server that I administer.

You can read more about it [on the website itself!](https://megalon.dev/#projects/software/this-website)
