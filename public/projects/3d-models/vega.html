    This is a model swap for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl!
</p>
<p>
    NASB features Jenny Wakeman from the TV show My Life as a Teenage Robot. Vega is sort of a parallel reality version of Jenny
    that lives on a different planet. Her design is similar, but more bug-like!

    My custom Vega model  vs Jenny's official model (right).
</p>
<p>
    This character swap was very difficult. Jenny's original model has many different parts, and a complex rig.

    The biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the model to import correctly into the game. The order of the bones must match
    what the game is expecting. Blender exports bones in alphabetical order, but the game's models weren't made in
    Blender!
</p>
<p>
    I had to write a C# script to rearrange the bones on import, and another to show the bone order in the inspector to verify it was working.

    The model was designed for Steven's <a href=https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/AltSkinsRehydrated>Alt Skins Rehydrated</a> mod. I used his template Unity project and skin export script to create the Unity AssetBundle loaded into the game!
