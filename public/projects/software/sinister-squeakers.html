    An arcade style shooter game made for "Mini-Jam 130"!
</p>
<p>
    The theme of Mini-Jam 130 was "Luna", with a limitation of "10 seconds". In our game the moon is made of cheese and every 10 seconds you are attacked by an ever larger horde of alien mice!

    This project was made in Unity and was a collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanmzart">ivanmzart</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I did the programming, SFX, and music. Ivanmz made the models, textures, animations, and logo! </p>
