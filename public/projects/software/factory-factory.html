    An interactive AI generated TV show
</p>
<p>
    Factory Factory was a TV show about a chaotic, interactive, AI generated factory! It took requests from Twitch chat
    to generate new content in realtime using ChatGPT and Unity.
</p>
<p>
    The project was designed to look like low resolution 3D simulation software used in a factory setting. I made most of the factory models myself in Blender.

    Factory Factory streamed live on Twitch. It has now shutdown, but the source is available on <a href="https://github.com/megalon/factoryfactory">GitHub.</a>
