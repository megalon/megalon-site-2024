    A complex model swap for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl!
</p>
<p>
    This project required a significant amount of research and trial and error. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl (NASB) does
    not support model swaps, and Vega is swapped onto a character with the most complex rig in the game, Jenny Wakeman
    (XJ-9).
</p>
<p>
    Jenny Wakeman (XJ-9) is from the TV show My Life as a Teenage Robot. Vega is sort of a parallel reality version of
    Jenny that lives on a different planet. Her design is similar, but more bug-like!

    The biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the model to import correctly into the game. The order of the
    bones must match what the game is expecting. Blender exports bones in alphabetical order, but the game's models
    weren't made in Blender!
</p>
<p>
    I had to write a C# script to rearrange the bones on import, and another to show the bone order in the inspector to
    verify it was working.

    Finally, I used Steven's <a href=https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/AltSkinsRehydrated>Alt Skins
        Rehydrated</a> template Unity project and skin export script to create the Unity AssetBundle that the mod loads
    into the game!
