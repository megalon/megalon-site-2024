    An arcade style shooter game made for "Mini-Jam 130"! The theme was "Luna" and the limitation was "10 seconds". In
    our game the moon is made of cheese and every 10 seconds you are attacked by alien mice!

    This project was made in Unity and was a collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanmzart">Ivanmzart</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I did the programming, SFX, and music. Ivanmz made the models, textures, animations, and logo! </p>
