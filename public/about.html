    Hi. I'm megalon.
</p>
<p>
    I have over 10 years of programming experience building tools, websites, games, and mods.
</p>
<p>
    Many of my projects are listed here on this website. I have a passion for programming, 3D modeling, digital
    painting, and music production. All of these are valuable skills in Game Development.
</p>
<p>
    I have collaborated on many open source projects through my GitHub, including maintaining the Beat Saber
    mod manager <a href="https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant">Mod Assistant</a> with 3 million+ downloads.
