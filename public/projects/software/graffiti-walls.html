    Graffiti Walls is a community driven VRChat world that provides the best spray-painting experience in VRChat!
</p>
<p>
    This project was a collaboration with my friends <a
        href="https://www.twitch.tv/hypervirtualextreme">HyperVirtualExtreme</a> and <a
        href="https://twitter.com/ivanmzart">Ivanmz</a>! I did Udon programming, 3D modeling, sound design, and
    project management.

<p>
    We would sometimes host a "synced instance" where it was possible to see the artwork that has been painted before you
    joined the world!
