    Hi. I'm megalon.
</p>
<p>
    I have 10+ years of programming experience, including 5 years using C# in Unity. In this time I created complex mods
    for 3 different Unity games: Beat Saber, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Ooblets. I have also released 2 small Unity
    projects of my own.
</p>
<p>
    In 2018 I created the <a href="https://discord.gg/beatsabermods">Beat Saber Modding Group</a>, a Discord server with
    200,000+ members dedicated to modding the VR game Beat Saber. I have collaborated on multiple programming projects
    through GitHub with other members of the community, including maintaining the Beat Saber mod manager <a
        href="https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant">Mod Assistant</a> with 3 million+ downloads.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see from this website, I have a lot of interests. Programming, 3D modeling, digital painting, and music
    production are all things that I have a passion for. I believe all of these contribute to my skills in Game
    Development.
