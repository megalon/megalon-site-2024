    This is my 3D livestream overlay that I use on my art streams!
</p>
<p>
    It's built in Unity and uses OBS's Game Capture source to remove the transparent background. This allows perfect
    transparency without using color-keying, and even allows semi-transparency.
</p>
<p>
    I made all of the models and textures for this project in Blender and Clip Studio Paint.
</p>
<p>
    I also wrote a custom C# library to connect with Clip Studio Paint to get the current tool and color. This data
    affects the color and tool shown in the overlay!
