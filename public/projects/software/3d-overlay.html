    A responsive 3D livestream overlay!
</p>
<p>
    Built in Unity, this project relys on OBS's Game Capture source to remove the background. This allows perfect
    transparency without using color-keying, and even allows semi-transparency.

<p>
    I made all of the models and textures for this project in Blender and Clip Studio Paint.
</p>
<p>
    I also wrote a custom C# library to connect with Clip Studio Paint to get the current tool and color. This data
    affects the color and tool shown in the overlay!
